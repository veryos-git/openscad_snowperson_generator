a openscad program to create 3d printed translucent stars
each star corner has randomly placed lines that are cut out at different z heights. due to the circular pattern this will create amazing looking patterns. due to the translucidity of a thin printed filament thicker parts will be darker when backlit. 

# slicing & printing

layerheight is crucial. if it is set to 0.12mm in parameters. it should also be set to .12 mm in slicer
also make sure to use concentric surface patterns!
